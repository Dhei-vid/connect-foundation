## üîß How to Use

### Viewing Mock Data
Simply navigate to the success stories page:
```
http://localhost:3000/success-stories
```

Or view the homepage stories section:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Adding More Stories
Edit `src/common/mock-data.tsx` and add to the `mockSuccessStories` array:

```typescript
{
  id: "9",
  orphanageId: "1",
  orphanageName: "Hope Children's Home",
  issueId: "issue-9",
  issueTitle: "New Project Title",
  title: "Success Story Title",
  description: "Detailed description...",
  impact: "Impact statement...",
  images: ["https://..."],
  beneficiaries: 100,
  cost: 2000000,
  completedAt: new Date("2024-10-15"),
  createdAt: new Date("2024-10-20"),
  updatedAt: new Date("2024-10-20"),
}
```

### Modifying Existing Data
Edit any story in the `mockSuccessStories` array directly.

### Testing Search
The search functionality works with mock data:
- Search by story title
- Search by description
- Search by orphanage name

## üîÑ Switching to Real Firebase Data

When ready to use real Firebase data, simply:

1. **Update Success Stories Page**
```typescript
// Change from:
import { mockSuccessStories, mockSuccessStoryStats, getMockOrphanageById } from "@/common/mock-data";

// To:
import { getSuccessStories, getSuccessStoryStats } from "@/firebase/success-stories";
import { getOrphanageProfile } from "@/firebase/orphanages";
```

2. **Update fetchSuccessStories function**
```typescript
// Change from:
const fetchedStories = mockSuccessStories;
const fetchedStats = mockSuccessStoryStats;
const orphanage = getMockOrphanageById(story.orphanageId);

// To:
const fetchedStories = await getSuccessStories();
const fetchedStats = await getSuccessStoryStats();
const orphanage = await getOrphanageProfile(story.orphanageId);
```

3. **Update Homepage Stories**
```typescript
// Change from:
import { getMockSuccessStories } from "@/common/mock-data";
const fetchedStories = getMockSuccessStories({ limitCount: 4 });

// To:
import { getSuccessStories } from "@/firebase/success-stories";
const fetchedStories = await getSuccessStories({ limitCount: 4 });
```
