# Help Page Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Help page is a new feature that displays verified orphanage issues/needs and allows donors to contribute directly to specific causes. This creates a direct connection between donors and orphanages, ensuring transparency and targeted support.

## Files Created

### 1. Main Help Page
**Location:** `src/app/(main)/help/page.tsx`

#### Features:
- **Issue Listings**: Displays all active (open and in-progress) issues from verified orphanages
- **Filtering System**: Users can filter issues by priority (All, Urgent, High)
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Each issue shows funding progress with visual progress bars
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive grid layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Hero Section**: Engaging hero with key benefits (Direct Impact, Verified Needs, Transparent)

#### Components:
1. **IssueHelpCard**
   - Displays individual issue details
   - Shows orphanage information
   - Progress bar with percentage and remaining amount
   - Donate button with heart icon
   - Priority and category badges
   - Issue images (if available)

2. **DonateDialog**
   - Modal dialog for donation process
   - Suggested amounts (₦5,000, ₦10,000, ₦25,000, ₦50,000)
   - Custom amount input
   - Donor information collection (name, email)
   - Optional message and anonymous donation checkbox
   - Real-time validation
   - Integration with Paystack payment gateway

### 2. Payment Verification Page
**Location:** `src/app/donate/verify/page.tsx`

#### Features:
- Verifies Paystack payment transactions
- Updates donation status in Firebase (completed/failed)
- Automatically updates issue's `raisedAmount` when donation succeeds
- Success/failure UI with clear messaging
- Redirects to Help page or Home after completion

#### Flow:
1. User completes payment on Paystack
2. Redirects to verify page with reference and metadata
3. Verifies transaction with Paystack API
4. Updates donation record status
5. Updates issue's raised amount
6. Shows success/failure message
7. Provides navigation options

## Navigation Updates

### Top Navigation (`src/components/navigation/top-nav.tsx`)
- Added "Help" link in main navigation menu
- Positioned between "Impact" and "Volunteer"
- Active state highlighting works correctly

### Floating Navigation (`src/components/navigation/floating-nav.tsx`)
- Added "Help" item with `HandHeart` icon
- Integrated into radial menu system
- Accessible from all pages

## Database Integration

### Collections Used:
1. **Issues Collection**
   - Fetches active issues (status: open or in-progress)
   - Filters by verified orphanages
   - Updates `raisedAmount` when donations are received

2. **Donations Collection**
   - Creates pending donation record before payment
   - Updates status to completed/failed after verification
   - Links donation to specific issue via `targetIssueId`

3. **Orphanages Collection**
   - Fetches orphanage details for display
   - Maps orphanage data to issues for showing location/name

## Payment Flow

### 1. Donation Initiation
```typescript
const handleDonate = async () => {
  // 1. Validate form
  // 2. Calculate amount in kobo (Naira * 100)
  // 3. Generate unique reference
  // 4. Create pending donation record in Firebase
  // 5. Initialize Paystack transaction
  // 6. Redirect to Paystack payment page
}
```

### 2. Payment Verification
```typescript
const verifyPayment = async (reference, donationId, issueId) => {
  // 1. Verify transaction with Paystack
  // 2. Update donation status to completed/failed
  // 3. If successful and targeted, update issue's raisedAmount
  // 4. Show success/failure message
}
```

### 3. Issue Update Logic
```typescript
// Get current issue
const currentIssue = await getIssue(targetIssueId);

// Calculate new raised amount
const newRaisedAmount = currentIssue.raisedAmount + paidAmount;

// Update issue
await updateIssue(targetIssueId, {
  raisedAmount: newRaisedAmount,
});
```

## Design Patterns

### Hero Section
- Gradient background (main-blue to blue-600)
- Three benefit cards:
  1. Direct Impact - 100% goes to the cause
  2. Verified Needs - All issues are verified
  3. Transparent - Track your contribution

### Issue Cards
- Image header (if available)
- Priority badge (urgent/high/medium/low)
- Orphanage location with MapPin icon
- Description (line-clamped to 3 lines)
- Financial information grid (Goal vs Raised)
- Gradient progress bar (main-blue to blue-400)
- Prominent "Donate Now" button (main-red)

### Empty States
- No campaigns message
- Heart icon visual
- Filter-specific messaging
- "View All Campaigns" button when filtered

## Error Handling

### Form Validation
- Required field validation (First Name, Last Name, Email)
- Email format validation
- Minimum donation amount (₦100)
- Real-time error display

### Payment Errors
- Paystack API failures
- Network errors
- Transaction verification failures
- Firebase update errors
- User-friendly error messages with toast notifications

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: Single column grid
- **Tablet (md)**: 2 column grid
- **Desktop (lg)**: 3 column grid
- All components responsive with Tailwind classes

## Key Features

### 1. Direct Targeting
- Donations are linked to specific issues via `targetIssueId`
- Ensures funds go to intended cause
- Real-time progress tracking

### 2. Transparency
- Shows exact amounts (Goal, Raised, Remaining)
- Visual progress indicators
- Public display of all active campaigns

### 3. User Experience
- One-click filtering
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
- Loading skeletons
- Success confirmations
- Email confirmations (mentioned in success message)

### 4. Security
- Server-side payment verification
- Secure Paystack integration
- Firebase security rules apply
- No direct amount manipulation by users

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_HOSTNAME=https://api.paystack.co
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send confirmation emails to donors
   - Notify orphanages of new donations

2. **Impact Updates**
   - Show how donations were used
   - Link to success stories

3. **Recurring Donations**
   - Monthly/weekly donation options

   - Filter by category
   - Sort by urgency/amount needed

6. **Donor Dashboard**
   - Track donation history
   - View impact of contributions
   - Download receipts

## API Endpoints Used

### Paystack
- `POST /transaction/initialize` - Initialize payment
- `GET /transaction/verify/:reference` - Verify payment

### Firebase
- `getIssues()` - Fetch all issues
- `getIssue(id)` - Fetch single issue
- `updateIssue(id, data)` - Update issue
- `getOrphanages()` - Fetch all orphanages
- `createDonation(data)` - Create donation record
- `updateDonationStatus(id, status)` - Update donation

## Component Props

### IssueHelpCard
```typescript
interface IssueCardProps {
  issue: Issue;
  orphanage: Orphanage | null;
  onDonate: (issue: Issue, orphanage: Orphanage | null) => void;
}
```

### DonateDialog
```typescript
interface DonateDialogProps {
  issue: Issue | null;
  orphanage: Orphanage | null;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSuccess: () => void;
}
```

## URL Structure

- Help Page: `/help`
- Verification: `/donate/verify?reference={ref}&donationId={id}&issueId={id}`

## Styling

- Primary Color: `main-blue` (#1d3557)
- Accent Color: `main-red` (red variant)
- Gradient: `from-main-blue via-blue-600 to-main-blue`
- Shadows: Hover effects with `hover:shadow-xl`
- Transitions: `transition-all duration-300`

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component with `fill` prop
2. **Skeleton Loading**: Shows while data is loading
3. **Parallel Data Fetching**: Issues and orphanages fetched simultaneously
4. **Map for Orphanage Lookup**: O(1) access time
5. **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows relevant UI based on state

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Error messages linked to form fields
- Loading states announced
